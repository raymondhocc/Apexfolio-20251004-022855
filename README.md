# Apexfolio: Simulated Trading Dashboard

[cloudflarebutton]

Apexfolio is a visually stunning and minimalist web application designed as a dashboard for monitoring a simulated auto-trading bot for Interactive Brokers. It provides a clean, intuitive interface for tracking simulated portfolio performance, viewing trade history, and configuring bot parameters. The application emphasizes data visualization and a serene user experience, making complex trading data easy to digest.

**Crucially, this is a simulation tool only and does not connect to live brokerage accounts or execute real trades.** All data is mocked and persisted within a Cloudflare Durable Object to simulate a live environment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Interactive Dashboard:** A high-level overview of simulated portfolio performance with key metrics, charts, and recent activity.
*   **Detailed Trade History:** A comprehensive, filterable, and sortable view of all historical simulated trades.
*   **Bot Configuration:** An intuitive interface to define and adjust parameters for the simulated trading bot.
*   **Simulation Logs:** A raw, time-stamped log viewer for debugging and understanding the bot's decision-making process.
*   **Minimalist UI/UX:** A clean, responsive, and professional design with a sophisticated dark/light theme.
*   **Persistent State:** All simulation data is persisted using a single global Cloudflare Durable Object.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS
*   **UI Components:** shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Lucide React
*   **Data Visualization:** Recharts
*   **State Management:** Zustand
*   **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers, Hono
*   **Database/Persistence:** Cloudflare Durable Objects
*   **Language:** TypeScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
*   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
*   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed and authenticated.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/apexfolio-trader-dashboard.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd apexfolio-trader-dashboard
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    The frontend and a local version of the worker will be available.
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```
    The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üíª Development

The application is structured into three main parts: the frontend client, the backend worker, and a shared types directory.

*   **Frontend (`/src`):** Contains all React components, pages, hooks, and styles.
    *   Pages are located in `/src/pages`.
    *   Reusable components are in `/src/components`.
*   **Backend (`/worker`):** Contains the Hono application running on Cloudflare Workers.
    *   API routes are defined in `/worker/userRoutes.ts`.
    *   Stateful logic is handled by the Durable Object in `/worker/durableObject.ts`.
*   **Shared (`/shared`):** Contains TypeScript types shared between the frontend and backend to ensure type safety.

When adding new features, define the necessary types in `/shared/types.ts`, implement the backend logic and API endpoints in `/worker`, and then build the UI components in `/src` to consume the new endpoints.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment to Cloudflare's global network.

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    bun build
    ```
2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    Run the deploy command. Wrangler will handle the process of uploading your static assets and worker code.
    ```bash
    bun deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click.
